# Brief Thief
Quickly (and easily) travel between personal, friends, and guild houses

This is a barebones ALPHA release so not many features yet. I will be adding more

# How to use

/guild to travel to saved guild house (/guild will help you add one if one is not registered)

/home to travel to primary house (and between free apartment) (/home > (jump to) primary > /home > apartment > /home > primary etc)
