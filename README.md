# Roam Home
Quickly (and easily) travel between personal, friends, and guild houses

This is a barebones ALPHA release so expect bugs and lots of content updates

# How to use

You can set up friends and guild homes easily in Settings > Addons > Roam Home

/home to travel to primary home (and between free apartment)

/guild to travel to saved guild home (/guild setup is automatic if not done in settings and will help you add one)
